# OpenChessBoard_HW

## Overview
- OpenChessBoard_HW is an open-source hardware project aimed at creating a digital chessboard.
- This project includes the design and schematics for the main board, which can be used to build a functional chessboard.
- This project is derived from [OPEN_CHESS_BOARD](https://openchessboard.com/index.php/2023/03/21/the-openchessboard-design/)
- This project aims to make the design of the board more modular and tileable for ease of manufacturing


## Features
- Single tile design (make 32 white PCB's and 32 Black PCB's and you are done!)
- Uses the Arduino Nano ESP32 as the uP
- Least amount of pins used
